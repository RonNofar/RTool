# RTool
A combination of every python tool I write for myself.

## What is it?
This is a variety of tools for audio, video, and image manipulation as well as some win32 wrapper functionality. Most recently I've started adding the tools that I am working on for Maya API.

## Where is documentation?
Nearly every script should be documented on its own and so you can call `help(<function_name>)` and fill the function name as appropriate.

## How can I get this?
You can install this package through PyPi's pip service. Simply `pip install RTool` will install the package to your system.
